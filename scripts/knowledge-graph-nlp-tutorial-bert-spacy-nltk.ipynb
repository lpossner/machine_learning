For example, we think, we make decisions, plans and more in natural language; precisely, in words. However, the big question that confronts us in this AI era is that can we communicate in a similar manner with computers. In other words, can human beings communicate with computers in their natural language? It is a challenge for us to develop NLP applications because computers need structured data, but human speech is unstructured and often ambiguous in nature.\n","\n","In this sense, we can say that Natural Language Processing (NLP) is the sub-field of Computer Science especially Artificial Intelligence (AI) that is concerned about enabling computers to understand and process human language. Technically, the main task of NLP would be to program computers for analyzing and processing huge amount of natural language data.\n","\n","### History of NLP\n","We have divided the history of NLP into four phases. The phases have distinctive concerns and styles.\n","\n","**First Phase (Machine Translation Phase) - Late 1940s to late 1960s**\n","\n","The work done in this phase focused mainly on machine translation (MT). This phase was a period of enthusiasm and optimism.\n","\n","Let us now see all that the first phase had in it −\n","\n","* The research on NLP started in early 1950s after Booth & Richens’ investigation and Weaver’s memorandum on machine translation in 1949.\n"," \n","* 1954 was the year when a limited experiment on automatic translation from Russian to English demonstrated in the Georgetown-IBM experiment.\n"," \n","* In the same year, the publication of the journal MT (Machine Translation) started.\n"," \n","* The first international conference on Machine Translation (MT) was held in 1952 and second was held in 1956.\n"," \n","* In 1961, the work presented in Teddington International Conference on Machine Translation of Languages and Applied Language analysis was the high point of this phase.\n","\n","**Second Phase (AI Influenced Phase) – Late 1960s to late 1970s**\n","\n","In this phase, the work done was majorly related to world knowledge and on its role in the construction and manipulation of meaning representations. That is why, this phase is also called AI-flavored phase.\n","\n","The phase had in it, the following −\n","\n","* In early 1961, the work began on the problems of addressing and constructing data or knowledge base. This work was influenced by AI.\n"," \n","* In the same year, a BASEBALL question-answering system was also developed. The input to this system was restricted and the language processing involved was a simple one.\n"," \n","* A much advanced system was described in Minsky (1968). This system, when compared to the BASEBALL question-answering system, was recognized and provided for the need of inference on the knowledge base in interpreting and responding to language input.\n","\n","**Third Phase (Grammatico-logical Phase) – Late 1970s to late 1980s**\n","\n","This phase can be described as the grammatico-logical phase. Due to the failure of practical system building in last phase, the researchers moved towards the use of logic for knowledge representation and reasoning in AI.\n","\n","The third phase had the following in it −\n","\n","* The grammatico-logical approach, towards the end of decade, helped us with powerful general-purpose sentence processors like SRI’s Core Language Engine and Discourse Representation Theory, which offered a means of tackling more extended discourse.\n"," \n","* In this phase we got some practical resources & tools like parsers, e.g. Alvey Natural Language Tools along with more operational and commercial systems, e.g. for database query.\n"," \n","* The work on lexicon in 1980s also pointed in the direction of grammatico-logical approach.\n","\n","**Fourth Phase (Lexical & Corpus Phase) – The 1990s**\n","\n","We can describe this as a lexical & corpus phase. The phase had a lexicalized approach to grammar that appeared in late 1980s and became an increasing influence. There was a revolution in natural language processing in this decade with the introduction of machine learning algorithms for language processing.\n","\n","### Study of Human Languages\n","\n","Language is a crucial component for human lives and also the most fundamental aspect of our behavior. We can experience it in mainly two forms - written and spoken. In the written form, it is a way to pass our knowledge from one generation to the next. In the spoken form, it is the primary medium for human beings to coordinate with each other in their day-to-day behavior. Language is studied in various academic disciplines. Each discipline comes with its own set of problems and a set of solution to address those.\n","\n","### Ambiguity and Uncertainty in Language\n","\n","Ambiguity, generally used in natural language processing, can be referred as the ability of being understood in more than one way. In simple terms, we can say that ambiguity is the capability of being understood in more than one way. Natural language is very ambiguous. NLP has the following types of ambiguities −\n","\n","**Lexical Ambiguity**\n","\n","The ambiguity of a single word is called lexical ambiguity. For example, treating the word silver as a noun, an adjective, or a verb.\n","\n","**Syntactic Ambiguity**\n","\n","This kind of ambiguity occurs when a sentence is parsed in different ways. For example, the sentence “The man saw the girl with the telescope”. It is ambiguous whether the man saw the girl carrying a telescope or he saw her through his telescope.\n","\n","**Semantic Ambiguity**\n","\n","This kind of ambiguity occurs when the meaning of the words themselves can be misinterpreted. In other words, semantic ambiguity happens when a sentence contains an ambiguous word or phrase. For example, the sentence “The car hit the pole while it was moving” is having semantic ambiguity because the interpretations can be “The car, while moving, hit the pole” and “The car hit the pole while the pole was moving”.\n","\n","**Anaphoric Ambiguity**\n","\n","This kind of ambiguity arises due to the use of anaphora entities in discourse. For example, the horse ran up the hill. It was very steep. It soon got tired. Here, the anaphoric reference of “it” in two situations cause ambiguity.\n","\n","**Pragmatic ambiguity**\n","\n","Such kind of ambiguity refers to the situation where the context of a phrase gives it multiple interpretations. In simple words, we can say that pragmatic ambiguity arises when the statement is not specific. For example, the sentence “I like you too” can have multiple interpretations like I like you (just like you like me), I like you (just like someone else dose).\n","\n","### NLP Phases\n","Following diagram shows the phases or logical steps in natural language processing −\n","![](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/natural_language_processing/images/phases_or_logical_steps.jpg)\n","\n","**Morphological Processing**\n","\n","It is the first phase of NLP. The purpose of this phase is to break chunks of language input into sets of tokens corresponding to paragraphs, sentences and words. For example, a word like “uneasy” can be broken into two sub-word tokens as “un-easy”.\n","\n","**Syntax Analysis**\n","\n","It is the second phase of NLP. The purpose of this phase is two folds: to check that a sentence is well formed or not and to break it up into a structure that shows the syntactic relationships between the different words. For example, the sentence like “The school goes to the boy” would be rejected by syntax analyzer or parser.\n","\n","**Semantic Analysis**\n","\n","It is the third phase of NLP. The purpose of this phase is to draw exact meaning, or you can say dictionary meaning from the text. The text is checked for meaningfulness. For example, semantic analyzer would reject a sentence like “Hot ice-cream”.\n","\n","**Pragmatic Analysis**\n","\n","It is the fourth phase of NLP. Pragmatic analysis simply fits the actual objects/events, which exist in a given context with object references obtained during the last phase (semantic analysis). For example, the sentence “Put the banana in the basket on the shelf” can have two semantic interpretations and pragmatic analyzer will choose between these two possibilities.\n","\n","\n","#### In this tutorial notebook we will be covering the following NLP libraries and its python implementation\n","\n","## Table of Contents\n","1.

Introduction <a id=\"KG1\"></a> <br>\n","### 1.1 What is Knowledge Graph? <a id=\"KG11\"></a> <br>\n","\n","A knowledge graph is a way of storing data that resulted from an information extraction task. Many basic implementations of knowledge graphs make use of a concept we call triple, that is a set of three items(a subject, a predicate and an object) that we can use to store information about something. \n","\n","**We can define a graph as a set of nodes and edges.**\n","![](https://cdn.analyticsvidhya.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/graph_link.png)\n","Node A and Node B here are two different entities. These nodes are connected by an edge that represents the relationship between the two nodes. Now, this is the smallest knowledge graph we can build – it is also known as a **triple**.Knowledge Graph’s come in a variety of shapes and sizes. \n","\n","### 1.2 Data Representation in Knowledge Graph? <a id=\"KG12\"></a> <br>\n","Let's take this sentence as an example:\n","\n","**London is the capital of England. Westminster is located in London.**\n","\n","After some basic processing which we will see later, we would 2 triples like this:\n","\n","**(London, be capital, England), (Westminster, locate, London)**\n","\n","So in this example we have three unique entities(London, England and Westminster) and two relations(be capital, locate). To build a knowledge graph, we only have two associated nodes in the graph with the entities and vertices with the relations and we will get something like this:\n","![](https://programmerbackpack.com/content/images/2020/01/Screenshot-2020-01-26-at-17.48.39.png)\n","Manually building a knowledge graph is not scalable. Nobody is going to go through thousands of documents and extract all the entities and the relations between them!\n","\n","That’s why machines are more suitable to perform this task as going through even hundreds or thousands of documents is child’s play for them. But then there is another challenge – machines do not understand natural language. This is where Natural Language Processing (NLP) comes into the picture.\n","\n","To build a knowledge graph from the text, it is important to make our machine understand natural language. This can be done by using NLP techniques such as sentence segmentation, dependency parsing, parts of speech tagging, and entity recognition. \n","\n","### 1.3 Import Dependencies & Load dataset<a id=\"KG13\"></a> <br>"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[{"ename":"OSError","evalue":"[E050] Can't find model 'en_core_web_sm'.

The Transformer reads entire sequences of tokens at once. In a sense, the model is non-directional, while LSTMs read sequentially (left-to-right or right-to-left). The attention mechanism allows for learning contextual relations between words (e.g. his in a sentence refers to Jim).\n","* **(Pre-trained) contextualized word embeddings** - [The ELMO paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.05365v2.pdf) introduced a way to encode words based on their meaning/context.

BERT is released in two sizes **BERTBASE** and **BERTLARGE**. \n","\n","The BASE model is used to measure the performance of the architecture comparable to another architecture and the LARGE model produces state-of-the-art results that were reported in the research paper.\n","\n","One of the main reasons for the good performance of BERT on different NLP tasks was the use of **Semi-Supervised Learning**. This means the model is trained for a specific task that enables it to understand the patterns of the language. After training the model (BERT) has language processing capabilities that can be used to empower other models that we build and train using supervised learning.\n","\n","**BERT** is basically an Encoder stack of transformer architecture. A transformer architecture is an encoder-decoder network that uses self-attention on the encoder side and attention on the decoder side. \n","\n","**BERTBASE** has 12 layers in the Encoder stack while **BERTLARGE** has 24 layers in the Encoder stack. These are more than the Transformer architecture described in the original paper (6 encoder layers). \n","\n","**BERT** architectures (BASE and LARGE) also have larger feedforward-networks (768 and 1024 hidden units respectively), and more attention heads (12 and 16 respectively) than the Transformer architecture suggested in the original paper.

Here CLS is a classification token. It then passes the input to the above layers. Each layer applies self-attention, passes the result through a feedforward network after then it hands off to the next encoder.\n","\n","The model outputs a vector of hidden size (768 for BERT BASE). If we want to output a classifier from this model we can take the output corresponding to CLS token.\n","![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20200407005130/BERT-embedding-output.jpg)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### 1.3 Why we needed BERT? <a id=\"A13\"></a> <br>\n","\n","One of the biggest challenges in NLP is the **lack of enough training data**. Overall there is enormous amount of text data available, but if we want to create task-specific datasets, we need to split that pile into the very many diverse fields. And when we do this, we end up with only a few thousand or a few hundred thousand human-labeled training examples. Unfortunately, in order to perform well, deep learning based NLP models require much larger amounts of data —  they see major improvements when trained on millions, or billions, of annotated training examples. \n","\n","To help bridge this gap in data, researchers have developed various techniques for training general purpose language representation models using the enormous piles of unannotated text on the web (this is known as pre-training). These general purpose pre-trained models can then be fine-tuned on smaller task-specific datasets, e.g., when working with problems like question answering and sentiment analysis. This approach results in great accuracy improvements compared to training on the smaller task-specific datasets from scratch. BERT is a recent addition to these techniques for NLP pre-training; it caused a stir in the deep learning community because it presented state-of-the-art results in a wide variety of NLP tasks, like question answering.\n","\n","The best part about BERT is that it can be download and used for free —  we can either use the  BERT models to extract high quality language features from our text data, or we can fine-tune these models on a specific task, like sentiment analysis and question answering, with our own data to produce state-of-the-art predictions.\n","\n","In **summary** the following are the main benefits of using BERT:\n","\n","**Easy Training**\n","\n","First, the pre-trained BERT model weights already encode a lot of information about our language. As a result, it takes much less time to train our fine-tuned model - it is as if we have already trained the bottom layers of our network extensively and only need to gently tune them while using their output as features for our classification task. In fact, the authors recommend only 2-4 epochs of training for fine-tuning BERT on a specific NLP task (compared to the hundreds of GPU hours needed to train the original BERT model or a LSTM from scratch!).\n","\n","**Less Data**\n","\n","In addition and perhaps just as important, because of the pre-trained weights this method allows us to fine-tune our task on a much smaller dataset than would be required in a model that is built from scratch. A major drawback of NLP models built from scratch is that we often need a prohibitively large dataset in order to train our network to reasonable accuracy, meaning a lot of time and energy had to be put into dataset creation. By fine-tuning BERT, we are now able to get away with training a model to good performance on a much smaller amount of training data.\n","\n","**Good Results**\n","\n","Second, this simple fine-tuning procedure (typically adding one fully-connected layer on top of BERT and training for a few epochs) was shown to achieve state of the art results with minimal task-specific adjustments for a wide variety of tasks: classification, language inference, semantic similarity, question answering, etc. Rather than implementing custom and sometimes-obscure architetures shown to work well on a specific task, simply fine-tuning BERT is shown to be a better (or at least equal) alternative.\n","\n","**A Shift in NLP**\n","\n","This shift to transfer learning parallels the same shift that took place in computer vision a few years ago. Creating a good deep learning network for computer vision tasks can take millions of parameters and be very expensive to train. Researchers discovered that deep networks learn hierarchical feature representations (simple features like edges at the lowest layers with gradually more complex features at higher layers). Rather than training a new network from scratch each time, the lower layers of a trained network with generalized image features could be copied and transfered for use in another network with a different task. It soon became common practice to download a pre-trained deep network and quickly retrain it for the new task or add additional layers on top - vastly preferable to the expensive process of training a network from scratch. For many, the introduction of deep pre-trained language models in 2018 (ELMO, BERT, ULMFIT, Open-GPT, etc.) signals the same shift to transfer learning in NLP that computer vision saw.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### 1.4 Core Idea of BERT <a id=\"A14\"></a> <br>\n","\n","What is language modeling really about? Which problem are language models trying to solve? Basically, their task is to “fill in the blank” based on context. For example, given\n","\n","“The woman went to the store and bought a _____ of shoes.”\n","\n","a language model might complete this sentence by saying that the word “cart” would fill the blank 20% of the time and the word “pair” 80% of the time.\n","\n","In the pre-BERT world, a language model would have looked at this text sequence during training from either left-to-right or combined left-to-right and right-to-left. This one-directional approach works well for generating sentences — we can predict the next word, append that to the sequence, then predict the next to next word until we have a complete sentence.\n","\n","Now enters BERT, a language model which is bidirectionally trained (this is also its key technical innovation). This means we can now have a deeper sense of language context and flow compared to the single-direction language models.\n","\n","Instead of predicting the next word in a sequence, BERT makes use of a novel technique called **Masked LM** (MLM): it randomly masks words in the sentence and then it tries to predict them. Masking means that the model looks in both directions and it uses the full context of the sentence, both left and right surroundings, in order to predict the masked word. Unlike the previous language models, it takes both the previous and next tokens into account at the same time. The existing combined left-to-right and right-to-left LSTM based models were missing this “same-time part”. (It might be more accurate to say that BERT is non-directional though.)\n","\n","But why is this non-directional approach so powerful? \n","\n","Pre-trained language representations can either be context-free or context-based. Context-based representations can then be unidirectional or bidirectional. Context-free models like word2vec generate a single word embedding representation (a vector of numbers) for each word in the vocabulary.\n","\n","For example, the word “bank” would have the same context-free representation in “bank account” and “bank of the river.” On the other hand, context-based models generate a representation of each word that is based on the other words in the sentence. For example, in the sentence “I accessed the bank account,” a unidirectional contextual model would represent “bank” based on “I accessed the” but not “account.” However, BERT represents “bank” using both its previous and next context — “I accessed the … account” — starting from the very bottom of a deep neural network, making it deeply bidirectional.\n","![](https://i0.wp.com/mlexplained.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Screen-Shot-2019-01-03-at-11.22.11-AM.png?fit=750%2C192)\n","\n","It’s evident from the above image: BERT is bi-directional, GPT is unidirectional (information flows only from left-to-right), and ELMO is shallowly bidirectional.\n","\n","BERT is based on the Transformer model architecture, instead of LSTMs. We will very soon see the model details of BERT, but in general:\n","\n","A Transformer works by performing a small, constant number of steps. In each step, it applies an attention mechanism to understand relationships between all words in a sentence, regardless of their respective position. For example, given the sentence,  “I arrived at the bank after crossing the river”, to determine that the word “bank” refers to the shore of a river and not a financial institution, the Transformer can learn to immediately pay attention to the word “river” and make this decision in just one step."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### 1.5 How does it work? <a id=\"A15\"></a> <br>\n","BERT relies on a Transformer (the attention mechanism that learns contextual relationships between words in a text). A basic Transformer consists of an encoder to read the text input and a decoder to produce a prediction for the task. Since BERT’s goal is to generate a language representation model, it only needs the encoder part. The input to the encoder for BERT is a sequence of tokens, which are first converted into vectors and then processed in the neural network. But before processing can start, BERT needs the input to be massaged and decorated with some extra metadata:\n","\n","* **Token embeddings**: A  token is added to the input word tokens at the beginning of the first sentence and a  token is inserted at the end of each sentence.\n","* **Segment embeddings**: A marker indicating Sentence A or Sentence B is added to each token. This allows the encoder to distinguish between sentences.\n","* **Positional embeddings**: A positional embedding is added to each token to indicate its position in the sentence.\n","![](https://towardsml.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/input.png?w=810)\n","The input representation for BERT: The input embeddings are the sum of the token embeddings, the segmentation embeddings and the position embeddings.\n"," \n","\n","Essentially, the Transformer stacks a layer that maps sequences to sequences, so the output is also a sequence of vectors with a 1:1 correspondence between input and output tokens at the same index. And as we learnt earlier, BERT does not try to predict the next word in the sentence. \n","\n","BERT is pre-trained on two NLP tasks:\n","\n","**1. Masked Language Modeling (MLM)**\n","\n","BERT is designed as a deeply bidirectional model. The network effectively captures information from both the right and left context of a token from the first layer itself and all the way through to the last layer.\n","\n","Traditionally, we had language models either trained to predict the next word in a sentence (right-to-left context used in GPT) or language models that were trained on a left-to-right context. This made our models susceptible to errors due to loss in information.\n","\n","Let us take an example to understand it better\n","\n","Let’s say we have a sentence – “I love to read data science blogs on Kaggle”. We want to train a bi-directional language model. Instead of trying to predict the next word in the sequence, we can build a model to predict a missing word from within the sequence itself.\n","\n","Let’s replace “Kaggle” with “[MASK]”. This is a token to denote that the token is missing. We’ll then train the model in such a way that it should be able to predict “Kaggle” as the missing token: “I love to read data science blogs on [MASK].”\n","\n","This is the crux of a Masked Language Model. The authors of BERT also include some caveats to further improve this technique:\n","\n","To prevent the model from focusing too much on a particular position or tokens that are masked, the researchers randomly masked 15% of the words.\n","\n","The masked words were not always replaced by the masked tokens [MASK] because the [MASK] token would never appear during fine-tuning.\n","\n","So, the researchers used the below technique:\n","\n","* 80% of the time the words were replaced with the masked token [MASK]\n","* 10% of the time the words were replaced with random words\n","* 10% of the time the words were left unchanged\n","\n","\n","**2. Next Sentence Prediction (NSP)**\n","\n","**Masked Language Models (MLMs)** learn to understand the relationship between words. Additionally, BERT is also trained on the task of Next Sentence Prediction for tasks that require an understanding of the relationship between sentences.\n","\n","In order to understand relationship between two sentences, BERT training process also uses next sentence prediction.

For example, if your task and fine-tuning dataset is very different from the dataset used to train the transfer learning model, freezing the weights may not be a good idea.

What is spaCy <a id=\"1\"></a> <br>\n","    \n","spaCy is a free, open-source library for advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) in Python. It’s written in Cython and is designed to build information extraction or natural language understanding systems. It’s built for production use and provides a concise and user-friendly API.\n","\n","If you’re working with a lot of text, you’ll eventually want to know more about it. For example, what’s it about? What do the words mean in context? Who is doing what to whom? What companies and products are mentioned? Which texts are similar to each other?\n","\n","spaCy is designed specifically for production use and helps you build applications that process and “understand” large volumes of text. It can be used to build information extraction or natural language understanding systems, or to pre-process text for deep learning.\n","\n","### 1.1 What spaCy is NOT <a id=\"11\"></a> <br>\n","\n","* **spaCy is not a platform** or “an API”. Unlike a platform, spaCy does not provide a software as a service, or a web application. It’s an open-source library designed to help you build NLP applications, not a consumable service.\n","\n","* **spaCy is not an out-of-the-box chat bot engine**. While spaCy can be used to power conversational applications, it’s not designed specifically for chat bots, and only provides the underlying text processing capabilities.\n","\n","* **spaCy is not research software**. It’s built on the latest research, but it’s designed to get things done. This leads to fairly different design decisions than NLTK or CoreNLP, which were created as platforms for teaching and research.

So we need a way to represent our text numerically.\n","\n","One tool we can use for doing this is called **Bag of Words**. **BoW** converts text into the matrix of occurrence of words within a given document. It focuses on whether given words occurred or not in the document, and it generates a matrix that we might see referred to as a BoW matrix or a document term matrix.\n","\n","We can generate a BoW matrix for our text data by using scikit-learn‘s CountVectorizer.

Bigrams would be a sequence of 2 contiguous words such as “who will”, “will win”, and so on. So the ngram_range parameter we’ll use in the code below sets the lower and upper bounds of the our ngrams (we’ll be using unigrams).

In other words, it’s a way of representing how important a particular term is in the context of a given document, based on how many times the term appears and how many other documents that same term appears in.

Tokenizing Words & Sentences</a>\n","\n","Tokenization is the process of breaking up the given text into units called tokens. The tokens may be words or number or punctuation mark or even sentences. Tokenization does this task by locating word boundaries. Ending point of a word and beginning of the next word is called word boundaries. Tokenization is also known as word segmentation.\n","\n","- <b>Challenges in tokenization</b> depends on the type of language. Languages such as English and French are referred to as space-delimited as most of the words are separated from each other by white spaces. Languages such as Chinese and Thai are referred to as unsegmented as words do not have clear boundaries. Tokenising unsegmented language sentences requires additional lexical and morphological information. Tokenization is also affected by writing system and the typographical structure of the words. Structures of languges can be grouped into three categories:\n","\n","    - Isolating: Words do not divide into smaller units. Example: Mandarin Chinese\n","\n","    - Agglutinative: Words divide into smaller units. Example: Japanese, Tamil\n","\n","    - Inflectional: Boundaries between morphemes are not clear and ambiguous in terms of grammatical meaning.

Mainly from regular expressions, we are going to utilize the following:\n","\n","\"+\" = match 1 or more\n","\n","\"?\" = match 0 or 1 repetitions.\n","\n","\"*\" = match 0 or MORE repetitions\t  \n","\n","\".\" = Any character except a new line\n","\n","The last things to note is that the part of speech tags are denoted with the \"<\" and \">\" and we can also place regular expressions within the tags themselves, so account for things like \"all nouns\" (<N.*>)\n","\n","Let us take the same code from the above Speech Tagging section and modify it to include chunking for noun plural (NNS) and adjective (JJ)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_uuid":"de9380cea9e1d9a803fa4eb7f704960d4ec0f3d1","trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["from nltk.tokenize import PunktSentenceTokenizer\n","\n","# Now, let's create our training and testing data:\n","train_txt=\"Crocodiles (subfamily Crocodylinae) or true crocodiles are large aquatic reptiles that live throughout the tropics in Africa, Asia, the Americas and Australia.
